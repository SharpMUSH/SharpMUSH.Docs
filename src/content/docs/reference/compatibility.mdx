SharpMUSH does away with some of the more unique aspects of PennMUSH parser curiosities.

<Card title="Unbalanced Parenthesis">

In PennMUSH, the following is legal, while is not in SharpMUSH:

```lisp title="SharpMUSH" frame="terminal" {"Instead use:":3} "> 3"
think add(1,2 
> 3

think add(1,2)
> 3
```

</Card>

<Card title="Full Recursion">

No support for full recursion parsing.
In PennMUSH, TinyMUX, etc, you can do the following:

```lisp title="SharpMUSH" frame="terminal" {"Instead use:":3} "> 3"
&fn me=ucstr; think [v(fn)](foo)
> FOO

&fn me=ucstr; think callfn(v(fn),foo)
> FOO
```

This is an awesome feature of MUSH-likes, but we explicitly do not support this, as it makes the parser non-deterministic and harder to maintain. Most existing Softcode does not rely on this behavior.
SharpMUSH introduces `callfn()` and `@callcmd` to replace this loss, which ensures most scenarios have a way to build the compatibility back in.
