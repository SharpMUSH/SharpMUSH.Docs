SharpMUSH does away with some of the more unique aspects of PennMUSH parser curiosities.

<Card title="Unbalanced Parenthesis">

No support for unbalanced parenthesis.
In PennMUSH, the following is legal, while is not in SharpMUSH:
`think add(1,2` -> `3`
<Aside>Use `think add(1,2)`</Aside>
`think add(1,2))` -> `3)` 
<Aside>Use `think add(1,2)\)`</Aside>


</Card>

<Card title="Full Recursion">

No support for full recursion parsing.
In PennMUSH, TinyMUX, etc, you can do the following:

`&fn me=ucstr; think [v(fn)](foo)` -> `FOO`
<Aside>Use `&fn me=ucstr; think callfn(v(fn),foo)`</Aside>

This is an awesome feature of MUSH-likes, but we explicitly do not support this, as it makes the parser non-deterministic and harder to maintain. Most existing Softcode does not rely on this behavior.
SharpMUSH introduces `callfn()` and `@callcmd` to replace this loss, which ensures most scenarios have a way to build the compatibility back in.
