SharpMUSH does away with some of the more unique aspects of PennMUSH parser curiosities.

<Card title="Unbalanced Parenthesis">

In PennMUSH, the following is legal, while is not in SharpMUSH:

```lisp title="PennMUSH" frame="terminal" "> 3"
think add(1,2 
> 3
```

Instead, complete the parenthesis.
```lisp title="SharpMUSH" frame="terminal" "> 3"
think add(1,2)
> 3
```

</Card>

<Card title="Full Recursion Parsing">

In PennMUSH, TinyMUX, etc, you can do the following:

```lisp title="PennMUSH" frame="terminal" "> FOO"
&fn me=ucstr; think [v(fn)](foo)
> FOO
```

Instead, use `callfn()` to call the intended function.
```lisp title="SharpMUSH" frame="terminal" "> FOO"
&fn me=ucstr; think callfn(v(fn),foo)
> FOO
```

This is an awesome feature of MUSH-likes, but we explicitly do not support this, as it makes the parser non-deterministic, ambiguous and harder to maintain. 
Most existing Softcode does not rely on this behavior however. 

<Aside>
SharpMUSH introduces `callfn()` and `@callcmd` to replace this loss, which ensures most scenarios have a way to build the compatibility back in.
